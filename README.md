## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

I'm a full-stack developer who blends logic with aesthetics — building clean, maintainable software with a user-first mindset.

## 🎼 My Development Ritual

- Editor: **Neovim**, custom-configured for clarity and control.
- Terminal: **Ghostty**, smooth and minimal, gets out of the way.
- OS: **Arch Linux**, lightweight and expressive — everything I use, I chose.
- Window Manager: **i3**, tiling and efficient, like clockwork.
- Browser: **Qutebrowser**, keyboard-first, Vim-native browsing — no mouse required.

## 🛠️ Tools in Context: Projects That Shaped Me

- **&iary** — a minimalist, write-only journal app built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.
  Designed for quiet self-reflection, it stores date-based entries in plain text, keeping the experience distraction-free and personal.

- **Inner Ink** — a local-first knowledge companion powered by **Tauri**, with **SQLite** storage and a custom rich text editor.
  Built to help thoughts grow roots — fast, privacy-friendly, and delightfully yours.

- **ERP Suite (Ongoing)** — a full-stack ERP system for college management.
  Backend crafted with **Django + PostgreSQL**, frontend with **Next.js + TailwindCSS**.

## 🌐 Fun Facts

- Switched my **Caps Lock** to **Shift** — because ergonomics is a language too.
- My idea of fun? **Tinkering with tech setups** — everything from custom terminal configurations to building a lightning-fast dev machine.
- **TokyoNight theme** is my vibe — it’s everywhere: from **i3** and **Polybar** to **Neovim**, and even **messaging apps** like **Beeper** and **Thunderbird**. Consistency, always.
