## 👨‍💻 Who I Am
Full-stack developer who spends more time configuring development environments than actually developing.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building
- **YourHomeInCalgary** — Real estate listings that don't make house hunting feel like a nightmare (**Next.js** + **PostgreSQL**)
- **Inner Ink** — Knowledge companion that doesn't judge your 3 AM thoughts (**Tauri** + **SQLite**)
- **ERP Suite** — College management system that actually works (**Django** + **Next.js**)

## ⚡ My Stack
- **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Django, PostgreSQL  
- **Editor:** Neovim (because I like my text editing with a side of philosophy)

## 🎯 Current Mission
Building meaningful software while obsessing over whether my terminal colors truly spark joy.
