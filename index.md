### Let me tell you something about Naffy Dharni.

1. The first thing is that he loves coding. And almost all github users do so. So this one is not special.
2. He is also interested in arts.
3. Did you know once upoooooooooon a time, his favourite subject was maths (which is the worst subject of all time).
4. But now his favourite subject is IT, of course because he loves coding.

### He also has a life moto:
```js
if (sad == true) {
  sad.stop();
  beAwesome();
}
```
